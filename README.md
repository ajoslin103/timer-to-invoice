Timer-to-Invoice


Installation:

  this "program" is intended to be used without a server -- but it does require internet access
 
  copy the index.html file to your desktop and drag it onto Chrome (it was developed using Chrome
  
  the file will load the various scripts and resources it needs from the internet 
 
 
Usage:

  drag timing export files (saved with the .html extension) into the line-item body of the invoice
  
  edit anything that is in yellow, use the 'x' icons to delete rows

  modify your rate/hr and update the totals accordingly


Printing

  there are css media rules that will hide operational things (like the X's and the drag-request) when printing


To Dos:

  automatically re-calculate the line item totals 
  
  add a grand total, and re-calculate that as well
