Timer-to-Invoice

- as of 2025-10-23, the Timing export format has changed, and this program has been updated to handle the new format

- Note

  recently I found I had to switch to Landscape mode in order for things to line up
  

- Installation:

  this "program" is intended to be used without a server -- but it does require internet access
 
  copy the index.html file to your desktop and drag it onto Chrome (it was developed using Chrome
  
  the file will load the various scripts and resources it needs from the internet 
 
 
- Usage:

  drag timing export files (saved with the .html extension) into the line-item body of the invoice
  
  edit anything that is in yellow, use the 'x' icons to delete rows

  modify your rate/hr and update the totals accordingly


- Printing

  there are css media rules that will hide operational things (like the X's, the drag-request, the re-calculate button, icons, etc...) when printing
